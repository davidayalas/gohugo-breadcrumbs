# Gohugo infinite Breadcrumb based on nested sections

With the templates [layouts/partials/breadcrumbs.html](layouts/partials/breadcrumbs.html) and [layouts/partials/breadcrumbs_recursive.html](layouts/partials/breadcrumbs_recursive.html) is possible to manage and infinite structure of folders/sections with no setup.

The only mandatory thing is put an _index.md file inside subsections [https://gohugo.io/content/using-index-md/](https://gohugo.io/content/using-index-md/)
